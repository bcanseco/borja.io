## Why not use Gatsby/Next.js/`x` framework?

I generally prefer Gatsby when building fast React-based apps. However, it doesn't yet support strong Content Security Policies. At least not easily. An issue tracking that is [here](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/10890).

Next.js is cool too, but my personal website is an opportunity to go crazy and roll a ["sensible setup"](../webpack.config.babel.js) myself. If anything, it's a good learning experience.
